         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>The third difference is, that before

Chriſtes incarnation the couena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of grace was adminiſtred with <note n="a" place="margin">Gal. 3.24. &amp;c. 4.1.2.3.</note> leſſe efficacie: but after with <note n="b" place="margin">Act. 2.17.

Chriſtes Aſcenſion abrogate thoſe ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices &amp; ceremonies of the old Teſtament, we muſt not therefore thinke any change in him.

But the Lord in abrogating thoſe ſacrifices, &amp; in preſcribing another forme of worſhip, hath neither altered his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, nor done any thing contrary there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto. For his ſcope in the ſeruice and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip preſcribed in both Teſtaments, is to bring his elect to the knowledge of their ſaluation in Chriſt. Neither hath he done any thing contrary vnto this: but in his great wiſedome he hath called and doth conduct co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinually his elect diuerſe waies to that end he appointed; as he thought beſt both for thoſe elder ages &amp; for theſe times vnder the Goſpel.

Therfore I ſay, the Lord firſt ſpeakes on this wiſe, to lift vp our hearts and ſoules by faith to
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:7575:92"/>
behold, conſider, and to feede vpon the things ſignified. The ſecond cauſe of the vſe of this phraſe in the Sacraments is, for that the verie truth is ſo, there is a reall preſence of the ſigne and the thing ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied to the beleeuer, for as he doth bodily and really participate of the ſigne,<note place="margin">Sacramenta ſunt ſigna exhibentia non ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cantia tantu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> ſo doth he ſpiritually, &amp; as really receiue and feed vpon the thing ſignified.</p>

                  <hi>ſurely they should be no Sacraments: and by reaſon of this likeneſſe, they haue often the names of the things,</hi> (which are ſignified by them.) <hi>Therfore as the Sacrament of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Chriſt, is after a certaine manner, the body of Chriſt; the Sacrament of the bloud of Chriſt, the bloud of Chriſt: ſo the Sacrament of faith is faith.</hi>

               <p>Whereas they obiect that it is not like that when Chriſt would miniſter vnto his Apoſtles, a ſpeciall comfort in aduerſitie, that then he ſhould ſpeake darkely and
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:7575:93"/>
doubtfully: the matter it ſelf ſheweth that this metonymicall phraſe ſeemed not hard or obſcure vnto the Apoſtles: for if they had not thought that the Lord called the bread his body, becauſe it is a liuely &amp; true ſigne &amp; Sacrament thereof, out of all queſtion they had bene much troubled &amp; diſquieted with ſo prodigious a matter, which neceſſarily followeth from the lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall ſenſe of the word: &amp; this may yet bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter appeare, for the ſame verie time they could not well conceiue and vnderſtand more eaſie and common <note n="a" place="margin">Ioh. 14.5.8 &amp;c. 16. v. 17.</note> argumentes. Therefore (I ſay) for that they were not troubled with theſe wordes, it is manifeſt that they vnderſtood them metonymical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, after the maner of the Scripture: &amp; the rather for that a little before, they had ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten of the lambe, which in the ſame ſenſe was called the paſſeouer: for that it was a ſymbole of that memorable paſſeouer, wherein the Angell <note n="b" place="margin">Exo. 12.27.</note> of the Lord ſmiting all the firſt borne of the Aegyptians, did paſſe ouer the houſes of the people of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raell: by which occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they were brought out of Aegypt, and ſo freed from that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme

               <note n="a" place="margin">Ioh. 6.55.</note> 
               <hi>meate indeed, &amp; his bloud is drinke indeed.</hi> And againe, <note n="b" place="margin">Ibid. v. 53.</note> 
               <hi>Vnleſſe ye eate the flesh of the ſonne of man, and drinke his bloud, ye haue no life in you:</hi> For the right vnderſtanding of theſe wordes and doctrine, which at the firſt ſight ſeemeth ſo ſtrange, and to the Capernaites (whom Chriſt then taught) moſt repugnant to all reaſon: and that the ſame may miniſter co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort vnto our ſoules, which is the right end and vſe of this cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiall veritie, two queſtions principally muſt be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſidered. The firſt is, <hi>VVhat kind
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:7575:106"/>
of meate the fleſh of Chriſt is?</hi> The ſecond, <hi>How or in what maner this meate is to be ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten?</hi> The ſame queſtion may be made alſo co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning the cup, as <hi>VVhat kind of drinke the bloud of Chriſt is?</hi> and <hi>in what maner muſt we drinke the ſame?</hi> Now then as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the firſt queſtion: If the fleſh of Chriſt bee meate indeede (as is before ſhewed) it muſt be either a corporall or ſpirituall foode. Corporall foode is that which nouriſheth him bodily that fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth thereupon, and this (to ſpeake after the vſuall maner and properly) is called meate. Spirituall food, is that whereby the ſoule or ſpirit of him which eateth is fed and nouriſhed: and this is called meate improperly, tropically, metaphorically, becauſe it hath the likeneſſe of meat, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly ſo called. For like as by natural food ſo properly called, the bodie is nouriſhed and ſuſtained: ſo by that ſpirituall meate the ſpirit and ſoule of man is cheriſhed, &amp; as nouriſhed. The ſame reaſon and deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption may be giuen of the corporall and ſpirituall drinke. And now it is certaine, that neither the fleſh of Chriſt is a corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:7575:106" rendition="simple:additions"/>
food, nor his bloud corporall drinke: for that no bodily ſubſtance is fed &amp; pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued either by the fleſh or by the bloud of Chriſt: For, to effect this, the fleſh of Chriſt muſt bee eaten with the mouth, chewed with the teeth, ſwallowed vp, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted, and ſo turned into that nouriſhing <note n="*" place="margin">Chilus.</note> iuyce in the ſtomach, whereof bloud is ingendred, and ſo deriued or ſent into all partes of the bodie, to be vnited thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, or altred and chaunged into the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance thereof, that the body may receiue his growth and preſeruation therby. And ſo in like maner, the bloud of Chriſt, if the bodie were to be nouriſhed thereby, muſt be drunke vp with the mouth, ſwallowed, &amp;c. But theſe things are againſt all rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and horrible to be ſpoken. And this was the verie cauſe, why the Capernaites did ſo tremble at the ſpeech of Chriſt, touching the eating of his fleſh, &amp; tooke it ſo in euil part, ſaying; <note n="c" place="margin">Ioh. 6.52.</note> 
               <hi>How can this man giue vs his flesh to eate?</hi> and againe, <note n="d" place="margin">Ibid. v. 60.</note> 
               <hi>This is an hard ſaying, who can heare it?</hi> For they vnderſtood Chriſt to ſpeake thoſe words of a bodilie food, which were to be taken
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:7575:107"/>
with the mouth, for the nouriſhment of the body. Wherefore ſeeing that it is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt by theſe abſurde conſequents, that the fleſh of Chriſt is no meate for the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy: it followeth, that it muſt be a ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all foode, and his bloud ſpirituall drinke, whereby the ſpirite and ſoule of man is fed and preſerued vnto life euerlaſting, like as mans body is nouriſhed and kept in this temporall &amp; fraile life, by corporall meat and drinke. And this Chriſt himſelfe ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to haue ſaid in theſe wordes. <hi>It is</hi> 
               <note n="e" place="margin">Ibid. v. 63.</note> 
               <hi>the ſpirite that quickneth, the flesh profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth nothing, the wordes that I ſpeake vnto you are ſpirite and life.</hi> And whereas the moſt of the beſt interpreters of theſe times expounde theſe wordes, of Chriſtes Deitie, as if the ſame were vnderſtood by the word <hi>ſpirite:</hi> ſo that Chriſtes mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning (as they ſay) is, that the power of quickning doth proceede from the Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of Chriſt: ſo that his fleſh hath power to quicken vs, as it is the fleſh of the ſonne of God crucified for vs. This expoſition no doubt is ſound and good, yet I thinke this be the moſt ſimple and naturall ſenſe,
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:7575:107"/>
if by the word <hi>ſpirit</hi> we vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d the holy Ghoſt, that the meaning ſhould be thus: my fleſh which I ſaid muſt be eaten, to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine eternall life, profiteth nothing to ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect this, if ye eate the ſame corporally, as you Capernaites vnderſtand me: but it is the ſpirit which quickneth, that is, the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt quickneth the harts of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and nouriſheth them vnto life euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting, by working in them effectually to beleeue in me, and ſo to eate my fleſh and to drinke my bloud ſpiritually, that is, by faith, whereby they are well aſſured that my fleſh was crucified for them, and my bloud ſhed for them for the remiſſion of their ſinnes. <hi>The wordes,</hi> therefore (ſaith he) <hi>which I ſpeake vnto you,</hi> of the neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of eating my fleſh to attaine eternall life: theſe wordes I ſay <hi>are ſpirite and life,</hi> that is, muſt be vnderſtood of the effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all working of the holy Ghoſt in the harts of the elect, to worke eternall life in them, euen by faith.</p>
            <p>Moreouer, for the better vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of this point, in what ſenſe, the fleſh of Chriſt is, and may truly be ſaid to be
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:7575:108"/>
our ſpirituall foode: we muſt expreſſe alſo in what manner it is made meate for vs. And this Chriſt taught vs in very plaine wordes, in that Sermon, where he ſaith, <hi>I am that</hi>
               <note n="f" place="margin">v. 51.</note> 
               <hi>liuing bread</hi> (that is, the quickning bread, or that bread that giueth life) <hi>which came downe from heauen: If any man shall eate of this bread, he shall liue for euer, and the bread that I will giue, is my flesh, which I will giue for the life of the world.</hi> In theſe laſt wordes, <hi>which I will giue for the life of the world,</hi> Chriſt ſheweth in what maner his fleſh ſhould be foode for vs, and that is, in that he will giue it vnto the death, <hi>for our life,</hi> that is, to merite for vs life e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlaſting, offring it as Prieſt himſelfe, a holy ſacrifice to God his father. And that this is the naturall ſenſe of this relatiue <note n="*" place="margin">Quam ego dabo.</note> 
               <hi>which</hi> in this place: as if the Lord had ſaid, <hi>quatenus cam dabo,</hi> in that, or for that I ſhall giue it, it is verie manifeſt by the matter it ſelfe, which is handled in that place. For if we ſhall not ſo vnderſtand thoſe wordes, as tending to declare the former maner of that thing which is here intreated: then that word muſt note ſome
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:7575:108"/>
diuiſion of a generall into ſpecials, as if Chriſt had two kindes of fleſh, of which the one he would giue for the life of the world, the other he would not giue. But this interpretation is manifeſtly falſe, and contrary to the articles of our faith wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on we ground the truth of Chriſtes incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. Therefore that expoſition of the relatiue <hi>which</hi> in this place is verie true and natural, and vſed to declare the forme and manner of that thing, which is there propoſed or diſputed vpon. And the very ſame interpretation is there of the words of the Lord in the inſtitution of his holy Supper, where, of that bread broken, he ſpeaketh on this wiſe; <hi>This is my bodie, which is giuen, or broken for you,</hi> that is, in <note n="*" place="margin">Quatenus.</note> aſmuch as, or for that it is broken or gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen for you. For that holie bread, or as Paule calleth it, that bread of the Lord, is not ſimplie the Sacrament of the Lordes bodie: that is, doth not ſimplie ſignifie and teſtifie that the Lord hath a true bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die: but ſignifieth and teſtifieth, that the Lords body is broken or giuen for vs, that is, was offred on the Croſſe with the fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:7575:109"/>
of Gods wrath, to make ſatisfaction for our ſinnes. And in like manner muſt we ſpeake and thinke of the other wordes, which the Lord pronounced, of the holy cup or wine: ſaying, <hi>This is that my bloud of the new Teſtament or couenant, which is shed for you and for manie, for the remiſsion of ſinnes:</hi> that is, in aſmuch as, or for that <hi>it is shed, &amp;c.</hi> By the premiſſes, it is now manifeſt, that the fleſh of Chriſt hath in it the nature of meate, not ſimplie but in a certaine reſpect: that is, in aſmuch as, it was crucified for vs. Like as the body is ſaid to be viſible, in reſpect of the colours thereof.</p>
            <p>Now concerning the ſecond queſtion in what maner, we eate the fleſh of Chriſt, and drinke his bloud: I anſwer: Such as the meate and drinke is, ſuch muſt be the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the eating and drinking thereof: but the fleſh of Chriſt is ſpirituall meate, and his bloud is ſpirituall drinke, as is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſhewed. Therefore the fleſh of Chriſt is eaten ſpiritually or in a ſpirituall man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and his bloud is drunke alſo in the ſame manner. Now to eate the fleſh of
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:7575:109"/>
Chriſt and to drinke his bloud ſpiritually, is to eate with the mouth of the ſpirite, that is, of the ſoule, to wit, by faith. Again, to eate the fleſh of Chriſt by faith, and to drinke his bloud, is nothing elſe but to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue in Chriſt, or to beleeue that the fleſh of Chriſt is crucified for thee, and that his bloud is ſhed for thee, for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of thy ſinnes. This Chriſt himſelfe ſheweth in the ſame Sermon, where he propoundeth two propoſitions or ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences ſignifying one thing: which are theſe: <hi>he that beleeueth</hi> 
               <note n="g" place="margin">v. 47.</note> 
               <hi>in me hath eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall life,</hi> and <note n="h" place="margin">v. 54.</note> 
               <hi>he that eateth my flesh, and drinketh my bloud hath eternall life.</hi> The matter alſo, and argument there handled requires this interpretation of the words of Chriſt: for if he meant by that phraſe of eating his fleſh one thing, and by that of faith another thing: then this conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent would follow, we muſt haue not one, but two wayes to life euerlaſting: one by eating the fleſh of Chriſt, the other by faith. But the way to eternall life is but one, which is Chriſt alone receiued by faith, or faith in Chriſt our Sauiour, both
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:7575:110"/>
come to one effect. And yet the better to vnderſtand this point, conſider a little what the nature of faith is. And this is knowen by his next and proper obiect, which is the Goſpell, or that teſtimonie which God hath giuen vs of his loue and grace for and through Ieſus Chriſt, for faith reſteth vpon the Goſpell as the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and infallible teſtimonie of God. And the Goſpell teſtifieth of Chriſt, that is, of his perſon and office, and of all his bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fites towardes vs: that is to ſay, that Chriſt is the only begotten ſonne of God, which for our ſake and for our ſaluation came downe from heauen, and was made man of the virgine Marie: that he liued an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly life according to the law of God, and hath brought vnto vs from the boſome of his father the counſell of God concerning our ſaluation: who being righteous ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for vs that are vnrighteous vnder <hi>Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius Pylate,</hi> was crucified, dead, &amp;c. And like as the Goſpell teſtifieth theſe things vnto vs; ſo the Sacramentes alſo teſtifie the ſame, for they are ſeales of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell, and as it were, a Goſpell ſeene and a
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:7575:110"/>
Goſpell felt. He therefore that beleeueth theſe holy teſtimonies of God, in ſo do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, he ſpiritually feedeth vpon the bodie of Chriſt &amp; ſpiritually drinketh the bloud of Chriſt. And thus doth Auguſtine,<note place="margin">De doctrina Chriſt. Lib. <hi>2.</hi> cap. <hi>16.</hi>
               </note> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounde this place of Chriſt. <hi>Vnleſſe</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ye eate the flesh of the ſonne of man, and drinke his bloud, ye haue no life in you. He ſeemeth to commande a horrible fact, and a thing moſt deteſtable: It is a figure comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding vs to communicate with, or to become partakers of the Lordes paſsion, and to lay vp ſweetely and comfortably in memorie, that his flesh was crucified and wounded for vs:</hi> thus ſaith Auguſtine. After the ſame ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner doth M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Iohn Caluin, that famous di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine of our age, lay open thoſe wordes of Chriſt, in his booke of Inſtitutions the 4. booke Chap. 17. ſect. 5.</p>
